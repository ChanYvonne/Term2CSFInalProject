Team Name: TBD (Word Masters?)

Project Name: TBD 
Description: Our project is essentially a word processor in GUI form. Users will be able to accomplish the following in our text editor:
  -Undo work line by line
  -Change text from standard style into bold, italic
  -Highlight text
  -Change text font and size
  -Change orientation of the text (left-justified,right-justified,centered)

Ideas to possibly implement later (WAY later):
-collaborating with other users and editing the doc in real time
-allowing users to email documents to other users
-allowing users to print their edited documents
