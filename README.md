# Term2CSFInalProject

Team Name: TBD (Word Masters?)

Project Name: Wizarding Word of Java
Description: Our project is essentially a word processor in GUI form. Users will be able to accomplish the following in our text editor:
  -Undo work line by line
  -Change text from standard style into bold, italic
  -Highlight text
  -Change selected text font and size
  -Change orientation of the text (left-justified,right-justified,centered)

Ideas to possibly implement later (WAY later):
-collaborating with other users and editing the doc in real time
-allowing users to email documents to other users
-allowing users to print their edited documents

#Start here when updating the readme. I will fix the version numbering later.

Different Fonts!
The ability to have a font be both bold AND italic

The dropdown menu and button positions
The dropdown menu has multiple selections that are the same thing. Need a way to remove them...
